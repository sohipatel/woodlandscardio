The technique allows cardiologist\u00a0to use the radial artery near the wrist as an entry point into the body, rather than the femoral artery in the leg\/groin area. By snaking narrow catheters and wires through the body&#8217;s circulatory highway to the heart, a cardiologist is able to expand a balloon, place a stent and open a blocked artery without surgery.<\/p>\n<p>Trans-radial angioplasty is prevalent in Europe, Japan and India in nearly 40 percent of cardiology cases. In the United States, the femoral approach has been the preferred approach for most percutaneous interventional (PCI) procedures. Only as more cardiologists are trained and gain the necessary skills to use this approach, more patients will have this alternative vascular approach as an option.<\/p>\n<h3>Procedure Video<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"img-frame full-half\">\n<div class=\"lightbox-zoom\"><a title=\"procedure video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vKN52tOBGDo&#038;width=800&#038;height=450\" data-gal=\"prettyPhoto\" class=\"hover-item\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"445\" height=\"273\" alt=\"procedure video\" src=\"http:\/\/www.woodlandscardio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/vid10-445x273.png\"><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Benefits of the Trans-Radial Approach<\/h3>\n<p>Specific benefits of the trans-radial approach include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower rate of blood transfusions and a lower mortality rate compared to the femoral approach<\/li>\n<li>Increased patient safety with less bleeding complications, hematomas, and possible nerve trauma<\/li>\n<li>Increased patient comfort since patients may sit up, stand and walk immediately after the procedure rather than having to lie flat for four-six hours with the femoral approach<\/li>\n<li>Lower complication rates, which equate to a increased patient satisfaction and even cost-savings as complications can be expensive<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Great Day Houston Interview<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<div class=\"img-frame full-half\">\n<div class=\"lightbox-zoom\"><a title=\"procedure video\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nyjloPZ7wlc&#038;width=800&#038;height=450\" data-gal=\"prettyPhoto\" class=\"hover-item\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"445\" height=\"273\" alt=\"procedure video\" src=\"http:\/\/www.woodlandscardio.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/vid11-445x273.png\"><\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Is the Trans-Radial Approach for You?<\/h3>\n<p>To determine if patients are eligible, a cardiologist will assess whether both radial and ulnar arteries of the hands are functioning normally. Known as the Allen\u2019s test, this involves simply compressing the arteries by hand to confirm whether there is a dual, or protected, blood supply making the trans-radial technique safe. Overall, more than 90% of patients are eligible for this inovative approach for catheterization and angioplasty.<\/p>\n<h3>Is the Trans-Radial Approach available for me?<\/h3>\n<p>Sanjay Patel, M.D., F.A.C.C.\u00a0is an interventional cardiologist who trained at Saint Vincent\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center in New York, and is an expert in performing trans-radial catheterization.<\/p>\n<p>He has performed more than 1,000 trans-radial catheterizations. His primary approach is trans-radial and more than 90 percent of his cases are done via the wrist.\u00a0He is now performing this procedure at:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stlukeswoodlands.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Luke&#8217;s The Woodlands Hospital<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.stlukeslakeside.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Luke&#8217;s\u00a0Lakeside Hospital<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.memorialhermann.org\/locations\/the-woodlands\/\" target=\"_blank\">Memorial Hermann The Woodlands Hospital<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a title=\"CRMC\" href=\"http:\/\/www.conroeregional.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Conroe Regional Medical Center<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Where Can I find more information on Trans-Radial Approach?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"ptca\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ptca.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Trans-radial Approach<\/b><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ptca.org\/radial\/interview_sanjay_patel.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Dr. Patel&#8217;s Interview\u00a0<\/b><\/a>on\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.angioplasty.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>www.angioplasty.org<\/b><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Training in Transradial Cardiac Catheterization and Coronary Interventions<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Transradial access has been proven to be the safest, most comfortable way to perform catheter-based procedures.

The course will have special emphasis on technique, basics, choice of guide catheters and coronary interventions.
