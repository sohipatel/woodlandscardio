A double-layered membrane called the pericardium surrounds your heart like a sac. The outer layer of the pericardium surrounds the roots of your heart&#8217;s major blood vessels and is attached by ligaments to your spinal column, diaphragm, and other parts of your body. The inner layer of the pericardium is attached to the heart muscle. A coating of fluid separates the two layers of membrane, letting the heart move as it beats, yet still be attached to your body.<\/p>\n<p>Your heart has 4 chambers. The upper chambers are called the left and right atria, and the lower chambers are called the left and right ventricles. A wall of muscle called the septum separates the left and right atria and the left and right ventricles. The left ventricle is the largest and strongest chamber in your heart. The left ventricle&#8217;s chamber walls are only about a half-inch thick, but they have enough force to push blood through the aortic valve and into your body.<\/p>\n<p>Read the rest of the article at the <a title=\"texas heart institutearticle\" href=\"http:\/\/www.texasheart.org\/HIC\/Anatomy\/anatomy2.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Texas Heart Institute<\/a> site.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The heart weighs between 7 and 15 ounces (200 to 425 grams) and is a little larger than the size of your fist.
